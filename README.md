# “Bringing the Power of Generative AI to Visual Storytelling”

## Overview and Origin
Perhaps no other medium showcases the computing power of Artificial Intelligence as spectacularly and as accessibly as video. Arguably the most preferred mode of informational transfer, the art of visual storytelling is one that has undergone countless transformations from the advent of moving pictures, to sound, to color, to special effects and beyond. At the precipice of the next evolution of visual storytelling, generative visual AI, sits a lone and dominating titan, Runway AI, inc.

Runway AI, inc. was founded on January 1, 2018 by Cristobal Valenzuela Barrera (CEO), Anastasis Germanidis (Chief Technology Officer) and Alejandro Matamala (Chief Design Officer). The three friends and graduates of New York University turned down multiple offers from top companies in their fields to build the startup that has amassed $237 million in funding since its inception, netting $141 million of that sum in their series C funding alone.

Born out of Cristobal Valenzuela’s early forays into filmmaking and nurtured by the founding trio’s fascination with the effects of AI on the visual medium, Runway AI has grown into a behemoth. Offering over 30 tools in their subscription-based suite, they are putting the power of AI in the hands of countless creatives around the world. From filmmakers like Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert who used Runway AI in their Academy Award winning film, “Everything Everywhere All At Once” to local small business owners looking for an edge, their powerful set of editing tools are empowering content creators big and small to create stunning videos at the fraction of the price of traditional video production.

## Business Activities
With the visual storyteller in mind Runway AI, inc. set out to create a browser-based suite to make cutting-edge technology available to anyone with a story to tell. Realizing the tremendous costs of video production, whether it be for a film or for an influencer’s social media content, Runway set out to fill that gap and gift the power of inexpensive video editing tools to the world at the price of a $15 a month subscription. Officially labeled an applied AI research company the company has repeatedly stated their commitment to pushing AI’s capabilities to facilitate an automated and enhanced editing process. Utilizing over 46 technologies the Runway AI ever-growing suite boasts (it’s calling card) text/image/video to video generation, high-resolution image synthesis, seamless video editing, and noise reduction and image stabilization technologies and more. 

## Landscape
After the roll-out of Gen-1 and now Gen-2, undoubtedly Runway AI’s claim to fame, many new companies and old ones are jumping into the text/image to video game. Among the competitors are Fliki, Synthesia, D-ID, Twelve Labs, Descript, Opus Clip and Pictory to name a few. But startups are not the only ones sniffing around the space, tech godfather Google and their parent company Alphabet, Inc. not only offer their own text-to-video suite but are also major investors in Runway AI, inc.

## Results
Runway AI, inc. has already made a huge impact on the visual storytelling world and in the AI space. The aforementioned film, “Everything Everywhere All At Once”, last year’s Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards, was able to stretch a miniscule budget and an under-manned visual effects crew by using Runway AI’s editing suite. With it’s growing suite and list of subscribers Runway AI, inc. is not just a name in it’s segment of the market, it’s become an AI powerhouse poised to become the name in generative video for years to come.

## Recommendations
I don’t pretend to be an expert in AI or to suggest anything substantial to one of the leading names in cutting edge deployable AI. As a filmmaker however I respect, obviously, the focus on visual storytelling but would also suggest that perhaps Runway AI, inc. could do more to bolster it’s sound editing suite. The unsung hero of cinema, most people don’t realize the contribution great sound makes to a film unless it is glaringly lacking. In other words, I’d like to see technology that takes Runway AI, inc.’s suite beyond common noise reduction and pushes it toward total soundscape evolution. With the advent of “360 sound” and other atmospheric sound advents, I could see applications like background noise, or even text/music to score creation in Runway AI’s future.
